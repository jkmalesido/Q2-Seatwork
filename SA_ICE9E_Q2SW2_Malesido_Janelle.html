		<td align="center">Golden Retriever</td>
		<td align="center">The Golden Retriever is an ideal family dog because it is lively, loyal, and particulary friendly. It likes to be around people and it is good with children. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland between 1840 and 1890. The dog was bred as a hunting dog that was suited for Scotland's wet climate. The Golden Retriever's ancestors include the Yellow Retriever, the Tweed Water Spaniel (extinct), the Irish Setter, and the bloodhound. Today, the dog is used as a guide dog, tracker dog, and therapy dog.</td>
